#File Size Challenge
##Task
In this challenge, given the name of a file, print out the size of the file, in bytes. If no file is given, provide a help string to the user that indicates how to use the program. You might need help with taking parameters via the command line or file I/O in C++ (if you want to solve this problem in C, you might be interested in this article on C file I/O).
